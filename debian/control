Description: Interface for running and managing KVM virtual machines
 Kvmrun is a suite of tools that provide a command line interface
 for creating and managing virtual machines based on QEMU-KVM.

 the most popular actions such as hot-plug/unplug devices,
 hot reconfiguration and live migration between the same type hosts.
